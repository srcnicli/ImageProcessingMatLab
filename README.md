Converting videos into frames and obtaining certain parameters with frames


This work has been used in the field of cryopreservation. Before immersion in liquid nitrogen, the oocytes must be exposed to the preservative solution. During this exposure, the response of the cell to the solution was recorded. In order to reach the volume values of the cell at certain times, the following two methods are used:

1.) The four-minute videos are splitted into frames.

2.) With image processing and analysis, the cell diameter/volume in certain frames was calculated.
